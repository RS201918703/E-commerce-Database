# An Insight into an E-Commerce Database (ST207 Project)
### Overview

### Motivation
We wanted to mimic a database of a huge e-commerce site like Amazon. We identified how a huge database like Amazon's could be broken down into operations and insights. We decided to focus on the insights portion because there is more room to interpret results. So, this database serves both customers and producers with insights into products.

### Description
The entire project was written with SQLite on DBBrowser. We established a connection from our ST207Database.ipynb file to do this. The dataset here has already been cleaned before inserting into the database, you can find the original dataset here: https://app.datastock.shop/?site_name=Amazon.com_Product_Reviews (You will need an account to download this). We have also added additional data from here: https://www.kaggle.com/promptcloud/amazon-product-reviews-dataset

### How to run
- Run the code in ST207Database.ipynb on Google Colab
- Before running, import amazon.csv into the environment
